  Artist: 'Bertram Priestman '
  Artist Years: (1868 - 1951)
  ArtName: 'The Heart of the West Riding '
  ArtYear: (1916)
  Description: >-
    The Heart of the West Riding depicts an imagined urban landscape based on
    the old West Riding of Yorkshire. The railway viaduct, the chimneys belching
    smoke from various factories and the cramped workers' cottages are
    juxtaposed with leafy trees and hills. \n Priestman's broad and vigorous
    handling of paint reflects the influence of French impressionism. His
    paintings of landscapes and coastal scenes combined the English Landscape
    tradition with French techniques, using a bright luminous palette. \n
    Bertram Priestman was born into a wealthy Bradford manufacturing family. In
    his youth he was much influenced by his older half-brother Arnold Priestman,
    who had been a pupil of Henry La Thangue.

    a non-voyeuristic quality. Afza has demonstrated that she can capture an
    evocative atmosphere. The rest of the series, includes architectural and

    building or the park. She has exhibited regionally and nationally.

  ArtYear: (1908)
  Description: ' Clausen was one of the most successful English painters of country life at \n a time when growing industrialisation led to nostalgia for a traditional rural England. This work is laden with symbolism. The upright figure of the boy takes time off his work to gaze into the distance, while the older man bends over his hoe, intent on his task. Youth is contrasted with old age, the future with the present, hope with acceptance. \n Clausen uses a palette of bright colours, applying the oil paint when very dry, producing a heavily textured surface,'

    La Thangue was a member of the plein air movement, a group of artists who

    in the fishing villages of Brittany.  \n La Thangue was born in Croydon, the
    descendent of a Yorkshire Hugenot family. He studied art in London and
    Paris, but gained a following of Yorkshire patrons including Asa Lingard,

    continued to study art at evening classes until the 1930s whilst working as
    a rent collector to support himself. He was also taught by the French artist
    Adolph Valetter, who had settled in Manchester. This is an unusually large

    thread of life when time is due. \n Since the mid-1990s, Caur's works
    involve a direct interweaving of her own visual vocabulary with that of the
    ancient vocabulary of Mithila. The women of Mithila, for hundreds of years,
    have painted scenes drawn from Hindu religious epics. Indian artist Caur has
    not visited Bradford but feels an affection for it as one of the first
    Western cities to collect her works.

    Born in London, Sanders photographed famous musicians in the 1960s and 70s

    his photography Sanders was granted permission and the rare privilege to
    photograph sacred places.  \n The Court of Lions is the main courtyard at
    the heart of the Alhambra and its Fountain of Lions is a symbol of strength,
    power and sovereignty. The Alhambra is a palace in Granada, Spain that was
    originally a Roman fortress built in AD889. The fortress complex was rebuilt
    around 1250 by a Moorish (Muslim of North Africa) nobleman and in 1333 was
    converted into a Royal Palace. It is known for its intricate decoration and
    Arabic inscriptions.

    Designs with calligraphy have been created out of many different materials
    and imitate the same effects of pen on paper. A mosque lamp is made by
    blowing hot malleable glass into a shape and then leaving it to cool. The
    enamel colours and gilding are then added on with fine brushes.  \n A Mosque
    lamp is traditionally an oil lamp usually with a large round bulbous body
    rising to a narrower waist, above which the top section is flared. There is
    usually a foot so they can be placed on a surface, but they were normally
    used suspended by chains. They were used to light mosques and other
    buildings in mosque complexes and continue to be used in many mosques today,
    but with plain or frosted glass lamps for electric lighting.  \n This lamp
    was made to an ancient design and decorated by one of the last surviving
    enamellers in Syria.
