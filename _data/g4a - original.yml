  Description: |
    William Shackleton was born in Bradford and educated at Bradford Grammar School. He trained at Bradford School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London before travelling to Paris and Italy on a scholarship. On his return he set up a studio in Chelsea with the artist Phillip Connard (1875-1958).  With the outbreak of war in 1914 he bought a cottage near Gordale Scar in Malham, Yorkshire, where he began to spend more time and used the local landscape as the inspiration for his paintings.
    
    Although Shackleton exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1895 and 1919 and the New English Art Club from 1899 he has always been considered to be outside the mainstream of British art producing varied work including realist and symbolist paintings.

  Artist: Stanley Spencer 
  ArtistYears: (1891 - 1959)
  Media: Oil on Canvas
  Purchase: Purchased in 1940
  Description: After completing his art training at the Slade School of Art, London, Spencer became well known for his paintings depicting Biblical scenes occurring as if in Cookham, the small village beside the River Thames, where he was born and spent much of his life. As his career progressed, Spencer often produced landscapes for commercial necessity and the intensity of his early visionary years diminished somewhat while elements of eccentricity came more to the fore. Although his compositions became more claustrophobic and his use of colour less vivid he maintained an attention to detail in his paintings akin to that of the Pre-Raphaelites.
